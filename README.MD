# Python TL1 Library

Note: This library is still a work in progress.

It currently includes a set of commands designed for use with Fiberhome devices.

The library offers templates for generating TL1 commands, making it easier to interact with Fiberhome equipment. Itâ€™s a starting point, and more functionality will be added in future updates
